; ConsoleVariables.ini
;
; Why we have this file:
;  A developer can change it locally to save time not having to type repetitive console variable settings.
;  This file should be in the source control database (for the comments and to know where to find it) but kept empty expect from comments.
;
; Details:
;  This file allows to set console variables (cvars) on engine startup (order is not defined).
;  This is the only ini file where we allow to load cvars marked as ECVF_Cheat. We don't load this file when compiling UE_BUILD_SHIPPING or UE_BUILD_TEST.
;  The variables need to be in the section called [Startup] (typical ini file syntax).
;  The name comparison is not case sensitive and if the variable doesn't exists it's silently ignored.
;  Lines are commented by a leading ";"
;  Using a friendly name (e.g. Yes, No, True, False, On, Off) is supported and it converts those into 0 or 1.
;
; Other way to set cvars:
;  in engine ini files (e.g. BaseEngine.ini, DefaultEngine.ini) in the [SystemSettings] section
;  from the in game console or in editor OutputLog
;  Device Profiles
;  Platform settings (editor UI)
;
; What if the cvar wasn't created yet:
;  The system creates a dummy cvar which is hidden by the system until someone creates a cvar with that name, then it copies over it's value.
;  This is also the reason why there is no error message if a cvar doesn't exits.
;
; Example file content:
;  [Startup]
;  r.FogDensity = 0.9
;  post.ImageGrain = 0.5

; Uncomment to get render graph executing passes as they get created to easily debug crashes caused by pass wiring logic.
;r.RDG.ImmediateMode=1
; Uncomment to get render graph to emit warnings for inneficiencies that are normally too CPU costly, and have draw event names

; (Setting r.ShaderDevelopmentMode=1 will also disable engine and app registration)

; Uncomment to enable frame markers in D3D12 for the Radeon GPU Profiler (RGP)
